#######
BERadio
#######
*BERadio* is an encoding specification and implementation for efficient communication in
constrained radio link environments.
It is conceived and used for over-the-air communication within the `Hiveeyes project`_.

Together with :ref:`Kotori`, a multi-channel, multi-protocol data acquisition and graphing toolkit
for building flexible telemetry solutions, it powers the `Hiveeyes system`_
``swarm.hiveeyes.org`` on the gateway side.

Feel welcome to join us!
